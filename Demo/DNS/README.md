## Steps:

1. **Set Up Network Topology**:
   - Create a network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer.
   - Include at least one DNS server, client devices (PCs), and network infrastructure (switches, routers).

2. **Add Devices**:
   - Place a generic server device to represent the DNS server.
   - Add client devices (PCs) that will query the DNS server.

3. **Connect Devices**:
   - Use appropriate connections (straight-through cables) to connect devices to switches and routers as needed.

4. **Configure DNS Server**:
   - Configure the server device to act as a DNS server:
     - Set the server's IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway in the device configuration.
     - Install DNS server software if applicable (emulate basic functionality in Packet Tracer).

5. **Define DNS Zones and Records**:
   - Define DNS zones and add records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, etc.) in the DNS configuration of the server device.

6. **Configure DNS Clients**:
   - Configure client PCs to use the DNS server:
     - Set the DNS server IP address in the network settings of each client PC.

7. **Test DNS Resolution**:
   - Use simulation tools in Packet Tracer to verify DNS resolution:
     - Ping domain names from client PCs to verify resolution.
     - Use web browsers on client PCs to test DNS resolution by accessing domain names.

8. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Monitor DNS server functionality and client connectivity.
   - Adjust DNS settings as needed to ensure proper domain name resolution.

9. **Save**:
   - Save the Packet Tracer simulation file.
