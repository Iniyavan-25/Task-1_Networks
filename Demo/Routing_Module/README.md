## Steps:

1. **Set Up Network Topology**:
   - Create a network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer.
   - Include end devices (PCs), switches, and routers.

2. **Designate Networks**:
   - Divide the network into separate subnets using switches and connect them via routers.
   - Example: Create "Network1" with two PCs and "Network2" with two PCs, each connected to separate switches.

3. **Connect Devices**:
   - Use appropriate connections (straight-through or crossover cables) to connect PCs to switches and switches to routers.

4. **Configure Router**:
   - Configure the router to enable routing between Network1 and Network2:
     - Assign IP addresses to router interfaces connected to Network1 and Network2.
     - Configure static routes or enable dynamic routing protocols (e.g., RIP, OSPF) as per simulation requirements.

5. **Assign IP Addresses**:
   - Assign IP addresses to PCs within each subnet:
     - Set IP addresses, subnet masks, and default gateways in PC configurations.

6. **Test Connectivity**:
   - Verify connectivity between PCs in Network1 and Network2:
     - Ping PCs across different networks to ensure routing functionality.

7. **Monitor and Adjust**:
   - Monitor router interfaces and routing tables to ensure correct network reachability.
   - Adjust routing configurations as needed to optimize network performance.

8. **Save**:
   - Save the Cisco Packet Tracer simulation file.
