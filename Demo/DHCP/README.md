## Steps:

1. **Configure the DHCP Server**:
    - Define the DHCP pool with the following parameters:
      - **Number of IP addresses**: Specify the range of IP addresses to be allocated.
      - **Name of managing server**: Set the hostname for the DHCP server.
      - **Starting IP address**: Define the starting IP address for the DHCP pool.
      - **Lease type**: Configure the type of lease (e.g., dynamic or static).

2. **Modify DHCP Settings**:
    - Adjust the configuration settings as needed:
      - Increase or decrease the number of IP addresses in the pool.
      - Change the hostname of the managing server.
      - Modify the starting IP address.
      - Change the lease type to either dynamic or static as required.

3. **Analyze the Configuration**:
    - Verify the correct allocation and release of IP addresses.
    - Ensure that the DHCP server is correctly managing the IP addresses.
    - Test the network efficiency by checking the connectivity of end devices.
